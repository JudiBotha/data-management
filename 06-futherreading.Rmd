# Further Reading {#further}

Here are some extra resources researched and shared by the class. 

---

**To add a section, please:**

1) Go to [the repository](https://github.com/jslingsby/data-management) for this web-book on GitHub.
2) Click on the "Fork" button towards the upper right to make your own copy of the repository in your own GitHub profile.
3) In _**your copy**_ of the repository on GitHub (online), open "06-references.Rmd".
4) Copy (don't just edit!) the example text* between the lines below, paste it below the lines, and replace with your link, name, text etc. You don't have to add your name if you don't want to, as long as I know your Git username.
5) Save and add a `commit` message along the lines of "Added new resource under further reading"
6) Next you want to perform a "pull request", which will send a request to me to pull your new code into the main (my) version of the repository. 
  - From your Github repo (not mine!), click on `Pull requests` (top left) and hit the green `New Pull Request` button.
  - Follow the instructions, creating a title, message, and confirming that you want to create the pull request (you may be asked to confirm a couple of times).

That should be it!

> *Note: For the example below, I copied, pasted and minimally edited text directly from the resource. This is ok, because they shared the resource under an MIT licence and I'm acknowledging them, but for this exercise I would like you to use your own words as far as possible.

## library(osfr) for interacting with the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) from R

[library(osfr)](https://docs.ropensci.org/osfr/) is an R package that allows you to interact with OSF directly from R. OSF is a free and open source project management repository designed to support researchers across their entire project lifecycle. The service includes unlimited cloud storage and file version history, providing a centralized location for all your research materials that can be kept private, shared with select collaborators, or made publicly available with citable DOIs. You can use library(osfr) to explore publicly accessible projects and download the associated files — all you need to get started is the project’s URL or GUID (global unique identifier). library(osfr) can also be used for project management by creating projects, add sub-components or directories, and uploading files.

## Lisa DeBruine and Dale Barr (2021) "Data Skills for Reproducible Research" 

Producing reproducible research requires learning certain skills and tools which allow for efficiently managing your data and record details of your analysis. DeBruine and Barr first show how to create a project in R Studio and the benefits for your reproducible workflow in doing so as you have a clear filing system which makes reading in data easy, for example. Secondly, an introductory tutorial on R Markdown is covered including how to embed exploratory visual analyses, such as figures, and tables, and preliminary analysis results in your R Markdown script. Finally, citing statistical packages is covered, which is essential in making the process of your data analysis more transparent and easier to replicate.

## Reproducibility trial: 246 biologists get different results from same data sets

In this article by Anil Oza, they speak on a paper doing research on the reproducability of ecological data. The paper (which is under peer review) showed that 246 different scientist got widely different results on the same research question and data set. This gives rise to their question of what can be trusted as a true and proper analysis with a correct result. Most of it boils down to not having a structure in place of how to analyse the data provided and different researchers having their own way to analyse the data. Having power-analyses to find the correct sample sizes and other standardised ways of reviewing the data that is not part of our field necessarily, like robustness tests used in economics, is a part of their solution. This article and paper further cements the importance of reproducability and its practices.
